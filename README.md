# Optimization for Data Science

You can find in this repository my solution to the labs of the *Optimization for Data Science* course at *Telecom ParisTech* by Pr. *Alexandre GRAMFORT* and Pr. *Robert GOWER* in the context of the *Msc Data Science*, a Master delivered by *Ecole Polytechnique*. 

- **Lab1**: First order methods (ISTA and FISTA) on regression models.

- **Lab 2**: Logistic and linear regression with deterministic and stochastic first order methods.

- **Lab 3**: Proximal/cyclic/greedy coordinate descent.

- **Lab 4**: Quasi-Newton methods.

- **Project**: Optimization strategies for the **proportional odds model**.
